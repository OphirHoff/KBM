If you’ve forgotten your password or want to change it, resetting it is simple. Just follow these steps:

Go to the login page and click "Forgot Password?"

Enter the email linked to your account and submit.

Check your email for a reset link (look in spam/junk if it’s not there).

Click the link and follow the instructions to create a new password.

Once updated, you can log in with your new password. Need help? Contact our support team.
